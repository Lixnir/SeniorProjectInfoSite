    <h1>Project Synopsis</h1>
    <p>The skills gap in the United States is a trillion dollar problem. Tetsing Each year US companies spend billions in hiring
        and training new employees. On the other side, workers and job seekers often find themselves missing skills that
        would make them more qualified for jobs they would like to have. FiTR Skills provides custom roadmaps which
        compare people's current skills with job opportunities and accessible education. Employers can post jobs and
        talk with potential employees that fit hiring preferences while job seekers are matched with employment and
        educational opportunities based on their current skills. Educators are able to post courses for specific skills,
        which can be endorsed by employers. All courses, job postings, and job seeker profiles have a skills-first
        approach to verify all stakeholders use a standard skills language and communicate throughout the entire career
        journey. To solve large scale problems such as the Skills Gap, how to deal with retiring Baby Boomers, and
        rapidly changing technology, FiTR Skills will offer a comprehensive, user-friendly platform to bring employers,
        educators, employees, and people together to promote flexibility in an ever changing job-and-skill's market.</p>
