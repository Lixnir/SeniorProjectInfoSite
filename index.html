    <h1>Project Synopsis</h1>
    <p>The skills gap in the United States is a trillion dollar problem. Each year US companies spend loads of money
        hiring and training new employees. On the other side, workers often find themselves missing skills that would
        make them more qualified for jobs they would like to have. FiTR Skills seeks to fill the gap by assessing skills
        the applicants have and listing out potential jobs that they are qualified for. Educators, employers, and job
        seekers are able to meet on the platform. Employers can create job postings and talk with potential employees
        that fit their hiring preferences while job seekers are able to obtain new skills for potential postings. If
        there are jobs that the candidate is less qualified for, FiTR Skills will recommend a list of courses
        preselected by employers to acquire the missing skills. Educators are able to create and list courses for
        certain skills, those courses of which can be endorsed by employers. All courses, job postings, and job seeker
        profiles will utilize the skills system to verify that each individual knows the skills they are listing and
        that the skills wording remain fluent throughout. To accomplish the goals of the FiTR Skills platform the system
        will be a comprehensive site allowing for growth along with the ever changing jobs market.</p>
